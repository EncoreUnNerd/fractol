# üé® Fractol

Welcome to the repo of my project 42 ‚Äúfractol‚Äù, one of my favorites. 

## Description of this project

The aim of this project is to teach us how to use the minilibx to display things on screen. More specifically, this project involves displaying fractals on screen. 

i really enjoyed this project, because fractals are stylish. my code isn't perfect as usual and can really be optimized. if you're planning to do this project, i recommend that you watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUlVFYJIUNA . This project is really fun to do and I REALLY REALLY REALLY RECOMMEND that you don't clone this project but just watch it if you ever get a little fuzzy.
